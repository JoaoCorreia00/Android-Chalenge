Day one: 
	Get used to Kotlin and android development since it's my first time using them in a project.
	To do that i started by setting up 4 squares in a grid.
	Next step try out the api, also add it in a simple way to the project so i can learn how to makes requests in kotlin.

Day two:
	Started by addid a navbar with icon plus added the cat images on top of the squares using the url from the api and the favorite bottom on top of the cat images.
	Then i started to fix the code and separating it in different files, so i could use some functions in all pages.
	Made the navbar appear in all 3 pages and made sure the selected page was highlighted in the navbar.
	Made the first step into the favorites page by adding room to the project.
	After that i created all the files necessary to create the data base to save the favorites cat id's.
	Then made the cat bottom functional, adding and removing the favorites from the data base.
